# incontrol2_webhook_notifications
Turning Peplink InControl2 HTTPS Notifications to Discord Webhooks!

This project doesn't relay PepVPN (now SpeedFusionVPN) connections as it can quickly build up logs when you have multiple interfaces or the connection simply refreshes. It will alert you to a PepVPN (now SpeedFusionVPN) disconnection if the tunnel fully drops.

## epx_sdx.php

This file is built to do everything the notifications may relay execpt for WLAN activity. 

## bal20.php

This file is built to do everything the notifications may relay inlcuding WLAN activity.
